# Airbnb Clone - The Console

## Description

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum, aiming to recreate a simple clone of the Airbnb application. The initial phase is building a command-line interpreter that lays the groundwork for the later stages, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration. The console will be used to manage objects for the Airbnb Clone website, including creating, updating, and destroying persisted objects, and managing the JSON serialization/deserialization processes.

## Command Interpreter

### How to Start It

To start the console, navigate to the project directory and run the `console.py` file with Python:

```bash
$ ./console.py
